# World Clock Alarm
World Clock Alarm allows users to view time and create reminders in different timezones.

### Motivation
There are a lot of people who need to keep track of the time in a different timezone. Some people work remotely with international clients, or some students have to study from their home country because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some peole and their loved ones live in different countries, or they just want to watch their favorite TV show on a satellite channel. All these people have to convert the time from the destination timezone to their local time. The World Clock Alarm app tries to solve the challenge of time(zone) tracking.
