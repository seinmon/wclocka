# wClocka
A simple world clock app with reminder functionality.

## Motivation
Time zone management is already available when creating events in calendar applications, but the difference is that sometimes you do not want to create an event, instead you just need a reminder, like *Call John Doe when it's 2:30 PM in New York*. wClocka simply does that!

## Contributing Guide
There are different ways to contribute to this project, including bug reports and feature requests. Currently, I cannot promise anything to be implemented in a timely manner. Hence, if you are an iOS developer, it would be faster to implement the patches yourself.
